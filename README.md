# Final-Degree-Project-2023


Here&Now is an interactive 3D web application designed to simulate a first-person video game environment. This application has been developed using technologies such as React, Three.js and Node.js, and is supported by a MySQL database accessed through Node.js.

The application offers an interactive space with a pet, which through fun and relaxing sessions, seeks to reduce the symptoms of depression and anxiety in teenagers. To do so, it guides users through sessions in a customisable 3D world, providing an immersive virtual environment that enhances the user experience.

The functional prototype of the application allows the scheduling and delivery of these sessions. In addition, it has a special section for psychologists, where they can monitor the patients progress and communicate with them.

PS: I had to delete all the 3d models, videos, audio and images due to their size in order to upload the project.
